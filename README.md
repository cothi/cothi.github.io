## resume

this is my resume project, Many developers write their portfolios in Notion. However, wouldn't it be better if you developed and submitted it yourself?

In the future, I intend to make it into a module so that anyone can easily create their own portfolio.



## start

```bash
npm install
npm run start

open localhost:3000
```

## TODO

1. [x] career time line component
2. [ ] create to pdf
3. [ ] Let me show you clearly what I'm trying to do
